# Expense Policy — Frequently Asked Questions

## Meals

**Q: Can I expense coffee or snacks during the workday?**
A: Daily coffee/snacks under $10 are not reimbursable (considered personal). Coffee purchased during a client meeting or team working session is reimbursable as a team meal.

**Q: What if a team dinner exceeds the per-person limit?**
A: The $75/person limit applies as a guideline. Overages up to 20% are accepted with a written justification (e.g., "client dinner at venue chosen by client"). Overages beyond 20% require pre-approval from your VP.

**Q: Do I need to list every attendee?**
A: Yes. For client meals, list the client's name and company. For team meals, list all employee names. For groups over 10, you may attach a separate attendee list.

## Travel

**Q: Can I book a premium economy or business class flight?**
A: Economy class is the standard. Premium economy is allowed for flights over 6 hours. Business class requires VP pre-approval and is generally reserved for flights over 10 hours or medical accommodation.

**Q: What about ride-sharing (Uber/Lyft) vs. rental cars?**
A: Use ride-sharing for trips under 30 miles round-trip. Rent a car for multi-day travel or when ride-sharing would exceed $100/day. Always choose the compact/standard category unless traveling with 3+ people.

**Q: Are tips reimbursable?**
A: Tips up to 20% are reimbursable for meals, taxi/ride-share, and hotel housekeeping. Tips above 20% require justification.

## Lodging

**Q: What if the $250/night limit isn't enough for the city I'm visiting?**
A: For high-cost cities (New York, San Francisco, London, Tokyo, Sydney), the limit is automatically increased to $350/night. No additional approval is needed. For other locations where rates are unusually high (e.g., during a major conference), request a per-trip exception from your manager before booking.

**Q: Can I stay with friends/family instead and get a per-diem?**
A: No. Contoso reimburses actual lodging costs only, not per-diems.

## Subscriptions and Software

**Q: Can I expense a personal productivity tool?**
A: Software must be directly related to your job function. Tools like IDE licenses, design software, or project management apps are reimbursable. General productivity apps (note-taking, personal calendar) are not, unless your manager confirms a business need in writing.

**Q: What about annual subscriptions?**
A: Annual subscriptions over $200 require manager approval before purchase. Submit the approval email with your expense report.

## Receipts and Documentation

**Q: My receipt is faded/damaged. What do I do?**
A: Try to obtain a duplicate from the vendor. If not possible, submit a Lost Receipt Affidavit (available from the Finance SharePoint site). You're limited to 2 affidavits per quarter.

**Q: Do I need a receipt for parking meters or tolls?**
A: For amounts under $15, no receipt is required — just note the date, location, and amount. For $15 and above, a receipt or bank/credit card statement excerpt is required.

## Approval and Reimbursement

**Q: My manager is on leave. Who approves my report?**
A: Expense reports can be approved by your skip-level manager or any manager designated as an alternate approver in the expense system.

**Q: Can I submit expenses from a previous quarter?**
A: The standard 30-day window applies. Expenses older than 30 days require a written explanation and VP approval. Expenses older than 90 days are not reimbursable except in extraordinary circumstances (extended leave, medical emergency) with CFO approval.
